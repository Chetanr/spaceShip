# We are building a space airport - Tech Challenge

We have been very busy for the past 12 months building aircraft hangars, digging safety tunnels and shafts, closing deals with NASA, SpaceX and ISA. Everything is almost ready and as a consequence of our partnership with SpaceX, we need to build our Ground Control flight dashboard to support their needs.

Elon Muskâ€™s engineers have provided us with the specs of their APIs and you can find it here https://docs.spacexdata.com

## Getting Started

From the docker folder of the project, run `docker-compose up -d`

- You should now have the UI running at http://localhost:3000 and the server running at http://localhost:4000
- You should now have a MySQL database running at localhost:3306
